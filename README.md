# DXGI wrapper for Photoshop

# Intro

In Photoshop 2021 Direct3D interface was updated to version 12 and some systems don't have support of [IDXGIFactory6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi1_6/nn-dxgi1_6-idxgifactory6) interface and its methods.
[DXGI wrapper for Photoshop](https://github.com/NGLEmp/ps-dxgi-wrapper) is useful if you get "Could not complete your request because of a program error" message related to your video card detection (Detected Graphics Processor: none).

# Glossary

## DXGI

- Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure ([DXGI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dx-graphics-dxgi)) handles enumerating graphics adapters, enumerating display modes, selecting buffer formats, sharing resources between processes (such as, between applications and the Desktop Window Manager (DWM)), and presenting rendered frames to a window or monitor for display.
- DXGI is used by Direct3D 10, Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12.
